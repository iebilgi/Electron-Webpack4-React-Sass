Electron, Webpack 4, React and Sass
-----------------------------------

Boilerplate for a setup based on Electron, Webpack 4, React and Sass with hot reloading, 
Babel will transpile ES6, allow arrow functions as class methods and provide a polyfill for async/await.

A css file is created by using *mini-css-extract-plugin*.

- npm install -> to unstall all npm modules
- npm run web -> to test app in a webbrowser (electron main process functionality is not available)
- npm run electronDebug -> to open electron window with console output
- npm run electron -> to open electron window without console output
- npm run bin -> to create app for mac (win and linux are in place, edit package.json)

I tried to keep it simple to inspire you. Feel free to suggest improvements :)
