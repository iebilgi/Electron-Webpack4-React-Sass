Electron, Webpack, React and Sass
----------------------------------

Boilerplate for a setup based on Electron, Webpack 2, React and Sass with hot reloading, Babel will transpile ES6 to ES2015.

A css file is created by using *extract-text-webpack-plugin*
ES6 arrow functions within React Components are possible by the babel plugin *transform-class-properties*

npm install
npm run web -> develop on localhost, main process features are not available
npm run electron -> open up in electron und work with main process features
npm run bin -> create darwin app

I tried to keep it simple to inspire you. Feel free to suggest improvements :)
